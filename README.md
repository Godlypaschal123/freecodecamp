# Project: Sentinel-Agro (Climate Resilience AI)
> Transforming hyper-local climate data into actionable insights for vulnerable micro-economies.

## 🌟 The Vision
To bridge the "data gap" in global agriculture. While global climate models exist, they often fail to provide street-level, actionable data for smallholder farmers. This project aims to build an **Agentic AI System** that ingests multi-modal data (Satellite + IoT) to provide proactive, local-language guidance to farmers via low-bandwidth channels.

## 🛠️ Technical Roadmap
My journey to mastering AI/ML and solving this challenge is broken into four phases:

### Phase 1: Foundations (Mathematical Intuition & Python)
- [ ] Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Statistics for ML.
- [ ] Data manipulation with NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

### Phase 2: Core Machine Learning
- [ ] Supervised/Unsupervised Learning (Scikit-learn).
- [ ] Mastering evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score).

### Phase 3: Deep Learning & Generative AI
- [ ] Neural Network Architectures (CNNs, Transformers).
- [ ] Frameworks: PyTorch & Hugging Face.
- [ ] Implementation of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for localized advice.

### Phase 4: MLOps & Production
- [ ] Deploying models via FastAPI and Docker.
- [ ] Edge AI for offline/low-power accessibility.
- [ ] Cloud scaling with AWS/Google Vertex AI.

## 🛰️ Data Sources & Tools (Target List)
- **Satellite Data:** [Google Earth Engine API](https://earthengine.google.com)
- **Climate Monitoring:** [Climate TRACE](https://climatetrace.org)
- **LLM Frameworks:** [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com) / [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co)
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

## 📈 Long-term Goals
1. **Open Source Core Modules:** Build a reusable library for processing satellite imagery for agriculture.
2. **Real-world Impact:** Partner with NGOs to validate the model in a micro-economy.
3. **Visibility:** Document the build process on LinkedIn and Dev.to to build a "searchable" personal brand.
